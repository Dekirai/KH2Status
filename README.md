# KH2Status
 Display your current Kingdom Hearts II Status.

## What is this?
**KH2Status** is a little tool mainly developed for randomizer runs.  
You just have to run the file while Kingdom Hearts II is active and thats it!  
It displays your the following values:  

 - Current Level
 - EXP to next Level
 - Current Strength
 - Current Magic
 - Current Defense
 - Current Max HP
 - Current Max MP
 - Current Location

You also can enable settings to output the values to a .txt file to make use of it in OBS/Streamlabs/etc.!    

If you decide to not output the values to files, the program automatically tries to delete the files so it will always stay clean.

This is how it could look like in OBS!  
I combined it with my personal KH2 Tracker which is unpublic. :)
